# Description

This project was created in the purpose of solving legal questions online rather than in person. This website is for the user to file a case with Morgan & Morgan as well as answering legal questions once becoming a client.

There are 24 legal questions inputted for the code so the lawyers can get the information they need to start legal action.

The website has 3 pages. 2 of which are questions for the lawyers to understand and get to know you as a client.

The goal for this project is to save the answered questions for when you exit, but when you come back it picks back up where you left off.
