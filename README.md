This project was created in the purpose of solving legal questions online rather than in person. This website is for the user to file a case with Morgan & Morgan as well as answering legal questions once becoming a client.

There are 24 legal questions that I inputted for the code so the lawyers can get the information they need to start legal action.

Above is what the home page looks like when npm start is ran in the terminal.

The website has 3 pages. 2 of which are questions for the lawyers to understand and get to know you as a client.

The goal for this project is to save the answered questions for when you exit, but when you come back it picks back up where you left off.

Using a database server is ideal to storing the information, but as of right now the program is using a .txt file.
